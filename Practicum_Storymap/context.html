        <p>It is hard to talk about the history of the Philadelphia Chinatown without the construction of I-676, also known as Vine Street Expressway. </p>
        <p>Although the highway serves as a significant thoroughfare through Center City Philadelphia, the indispensable repercussions on the adjacent neighborhoods still lingers today. Consequences of the highway such as demolishment of buildings, pedestrian safety threats, traffic congestion, as well as noise and air pollution had been harming Chinatown and its surrounding neighborhoods over the past decades and are yet to be addressed. </p>
        <p>The changing dynamics of the neighborhood also adds other layers to the historical issues. As the socioeconomic status alters, new problems such as gentrification and low land use efficiency only worsen the existing conditions of the Chinatown region.</p>

        <p>Callowhill was originally an industrial hub with factories, warehouses, and rail infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The Reading Viaduct, built in the late 19th century, helped support manufacturing and trade.</p>
        <p>Industrial decline began after World War II, leading to vacant buildings and economic downturn.</p>

          <p>The first Chinese-owned business, Lee Fong’s laundry, opened in 1871, leading to the rise of laundries, restaurants, and grocery stores.</p>

        <h3>Problem 1: Gentrification</h3>
        <p>The Philadelphia Chinatown was added to America's most Endangered Historic Places by the Nation Trust for Historic Preservation in 2023. From outside, Philadelphia Chinatown may look prospective with a large daily influx of visitors coming here for grocery shopping or food, and the neighborhood seems to be well-preserved as one of the oldest Chinatown in the United States. Truth is that the area has been struggling under the increasing impact of gentrification over time. Throughout history, several large-scale development projects including the construction of the Vine Street Expressway had led to the displacement of businesses and residents as the area became more “desirable.” Responding to the changes in the neighborhood, higher cost of living and increasing property values soon followed, making the land less and less affordable for low-income immigrants. Aside from physical changes, the demographics of Chinatown became more diversified as the Asian population decreased. Another contributor to gentrification was the shift in priorities of the young generation for they may no longer be interested in taking over family businesses, making the community gradually lose its cultural identity.

        <h3>Problem 2: Barrier effects created by highways</h3>
        <p>Vine Street Expressway physically divided the neighborhood into halves, limiting the accessibility and connectivity within the north and south sides of the neighborhood. (How much of the highway’s impact will get mentioned in the history part?)

        <h3>Problem 3: Low efficiency land use</h3>
        <p>As of today, land use within the boundary of our study area is not being utilized effectively with a relatively large portion of vacant space north of the Vine Street Expressway. (Do we have the data/research  to support this? Or should we include the lack of green spaces in this section as well?)</p>
