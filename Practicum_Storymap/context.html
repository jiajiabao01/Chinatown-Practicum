        <h1>The Birth of Philadelphia Chinatown</h1>
        <p>Chinatown emerged in the 1870s as Chinese immigrants, facing hostility in the West, established a small community centered around Race Street.  </p>
        <p>The first Chinese-owned business, Lee Fong’s laundry, opened in 1871, leading to the rise of laundries, restaurants, and grocery stores.</p>

      <h1>Industrialization and Population Growth</h1>
      <p>During the mid-20th century, Chinatown faced restrictions on expansion due to anti-Asian discrimination and housing policies. </p>
      <p>Large-scale urban renewal projects, including the widening of Vine Street and the construction of the Vine Street Expressway, led to housing demolitions and displacement, threatening the neighborhood’s survival and reshaping its landscape.</p>

      <p>Post-World War II, Callowhill experienced a decline as industries relocated or closed, and residents moved to suburbs. </p>
      <p>The construction of the Vine Street Expressway in the 1980s further isolated the neighborhood. Urban renewal projects aimed to revitalize the area, but many were unsuccessful, leaving behind vacant lots and underutilized buildings.</p>
