      <h1>1. Property Price vs Distance to Highway</h1>
      <h3>Philadelphia Scale Analysis</h3>
      <p>Traditionally, it is understood that property price increases as the distance to highways increases. [add summary sentences from Jeff Lin paper]</p>
      <p>Looking at the four major highways in Philadelphia (US-1, I-76, I-95, I-676), we discovered that the relationship between highways and property values is a bit more complex and that it varies from case to case. [explicitly mention conflicting relationship: negative correlation for properties near I-95 and positive correlation for properties near I-676]</p>

  <section class="slide layout3">
    <div class="text">
      <h3>Discontinuity and Disappearing Highway Effects</h3>
      <p>When we focused our analyses on our study area, we found that I-676 affected property prices differently in the North side (Callowhill) compared to South (Chinatown), suggesting that there are other, more influential factors at play that dictate property price.</p>
      <p>As we add other factors like distance to Center City and [feature 2], distance to highway has less influence on property prices.</p>
      <p>When only considering distance to I-676, property prices increase $XX per square foot as we move 100m [or other more commonly understood measurement of space like a block]. When we add other aspects of a property,property prices increase $XX per square foot as we move 100m.</p>
