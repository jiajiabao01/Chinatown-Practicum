        <p>It is hard to talk about the history of the Philadelphia Chinatown without the construction of I-676, also known as Vine Street Expressway. </p>
        <p>Although the highway serves as a significant thoroughfare through Center City Philadelphia, the indispensable repercussions on the adjacent neighborhoods still lingers today. Consequences of the highway such as demolishment of buildings, pedestrian safety threats, traffic congestion, as well as noise and air pollution had been harming Chinatown and its surrounding neighborhoods over the past decades and are yet to be addressed. </p>
        <p>The changing dynamics of the neighborhood also adds other layers to the historical issues. As the socioeconomic status alters, new problems such as gentrification and low land use efficiency only worsen the existing conditions of the Chinatown region.</p>
