## Description

This repository documents the data analysis part of the project. Our outcomes will be 3 models:

1. **A linear model** highlights the relationship between housing markets and highway;
2. **A regression discontinuity model** to analyze the quantitative difference in the disamenity effect of the highway between the southern and northern halves of Chinatown;
3. **A predictive model** to estimate the housing market after the completion of Phase 1 of the Chinatown Stitch project.

## Guidelines
* **1.28-2.18: 1st Presentation**
  * Data Wrangling: Wrangle basic predictors of value at the property level, including spatial fixed effects.
  * Exploratory Analysis (Most Critical): Use data to tell a story about the relationship between properties and urban highways - city-wide, and in the context of your neighborhood. You will also want to tell a rich story about your study area and about the context of the Stitch.
* **3.4-4.1: 2nd Presentation**
  * Modeling: Build three models for this project: a linear model, a regression discontinuity model, a predictive model.
* **4.8-4.29: Final Presentation**
  * App Development
